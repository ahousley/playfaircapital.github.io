title: Playfair Capital Startup Operating Manual 
---

The Playfair Capital Startup Opearting Manual is a playbook we created to document our knowledge and best practices for building and scaling startups. It's free for any startup to access as well as contribute to. 

So what's included? 

We are frequently adding new information to this and we encourage you to contribute to it also. You can find best practices and checklists for: 

- Recruitment 
- Branding 
- Analytics
- Customer feedback 
- Leadership 
- Media & PR 
- Legal 

& more to come...

How to use this playbook? 

You can just use this playbook as a source of reference. Alternatively, you can easily clone this startup playbook by forking the project and creating your own so that you can customise it to your own startup - we actually think this is the best way to get the most from it.
