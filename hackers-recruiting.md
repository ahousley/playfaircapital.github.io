# The Hacker's Guide to Referral Recruiting

Do you know where your next 10 employees will come from? The answer is: Referrals. Take this as fact, not opinion. Recruiting through you and your employees’ networks is the only viable way of building your team in the early days (recruiters are expensive and have misaligned incentives; advertising has relatively low ROI, particularly for tech talent; sourcing is time consuming). There is no other sane way to build your team other than through referrals.

Bear the following in mind as well. Referred candidates are consistently rated the highest quality hires, the most productive employees, the strongest culture fit and the lowest cost to recruit. They’re also the most likely to accept offers and the least likely to quit once hired.

Great people tend to know one another and great talent tends to congregate in tight-knit networks. Hire the right people in the early days and you’ll open up whole new networks of exceptional talent. To do this you’ll have to master the science of recruiting through you and your employees’ networks. But first, consider the following story about Max Levchin and Peter Thiel’s efforts to build their early teams at PayPal:

Levchin and the early team at PayPal limited the number of agonising hiring decisions by bringing in people they knew. The first 10 engineers at PayPal went to school with Levchin. The first five business hires came from Peter Thiel's network at Stanford. While resumes, rigorous interviews and LinkedIn profiles provide a good proxy, the most foolproof way to recruit a good person is to know, over years of interaction, that the person is great.

Levchin recounts the following exercise, “Peter [Thiel] sat me down and he made me write down every smart person I knew in college personally. Turned out to be a list of about 30 people and we ended up hiring about 24 of those.”  

You can’t rule potential hires out just because you don’t think you can win them. He went on to note, “We had this cascading effect where our team would be forced to write down everybody smart they knew that they were absolutely confident they could never hire. We then went after them like banshees and they would eventually crack." (source)

So do you know how to effectively mine your networks to maximise the number of leads that are generated? If not, fear not. This is your “how to” guide. It will teach you how exactly to comprehensively mine all of your available networks to secure awesome hires.

Finally, the results (i.e. the number of quality leads) you’ll generate from your referral program will be a function of two variables:

How effectively you run it and whether you implement all of the steps in this guide;
The time and effort you put in.

It’s that simple. Oh and don’t forget the adage that “when everyone is responsible, no one is responsible”. Create accountability by making this exercise your, or someone on your team’s, responsibility.

A note on referral bonuses

You should absolutely pay a referral bonus when someone is hired. £1,000 - £3,000 is reasonable for an early stage startup. You might think this is a lot, but ask yourself how much you’d have to pay an external recruiter to find you an engineer, a COO or a marketing person. Or how much effort it would take you and your cofounder to source and hire all of these roles alone. Although getting a bonus isn’t the primary motivator for an employee to refer someone (wanting to work with awesome people is), it does broadcast the message to your company that you're serious about hiring and willing to put your money where your mouth is.

What doesn’t work

What doesn’t work is the traditional approach to referral recruiting: You create a job spec, you email it to your staff asking if they know anyone relevant, they spend a few minutes thinking about who they know, they email some names to you or the job spec to some of their contacts. And then everyone goes back to doing their jobs. If you’re lucky you’ll end up with a few good leads and, if you’re really lucky, you’ll make some great hires. But startups aren’t built with luck, they’re built with hard work and graft. So you should apply that to your recruiting.

This is how to proactively mine you and your staff’s networks for hiring gold

The key is to take this traditional approach and give it steroids. These are the steps involved:

Create a master list for all of the leads
Lead generation: Bring everyone together, mine their networks and populate the master list
Contact every candidate
Effectively manage each candidate you activate

Peter Kazanjy, co-founder of TalentBin says to “treat it like a sales campaign. You’ll get results. In my experience, when you approach problems like recruiting with a rigorous, B2B sales mindset, you will get good outcomes.”

Create a master list

This is the easy part. Create a google spreadsheet, add some columns, share it with your team. Here’s what a final product looks like:



Lead generation

To start, tell the employees who should go on the list: Anyone you think is good enough to work at this company. Don’t limit the list to people who are actively looking or who are likely to consider new opportunities. I like to say something like: “I don’t care if they have their own startup, if they just started at Google or if they’re living at the North Pole… if they’re good enough to work here, put their name on the list.” Ask yourself, "does this person meet our hiring standards? Would you be excited to work with them again?" Yes? Cool, put their name on the list.

Sit down individually with each team member. Start by reminding them of the importance to the success of the company of hiring from referrals and of the referral bonus they’ll get if you hire one of their leads. 

LinkedIn

Have your employees log in to LinkedIn and do a "first degree network" search to return all of their immediate connections. Here’s a link to that search (make sure ‘they’re logged into LinkedIn):
https://www.linkedin.com/vsearch/p?openAdvancedForm=true&locationType=Y&f_N=F&rsid=788444611437492479850&orig=ADVS

One by one, trawl through each results page applying the criteria you previously laid down to identify people good enough for the position. “John Farmer, is he good enough to work here?” No. “Elena Stroud, is she good enough to work here?” Yes. Then put her name and email address on the list. Forget about follow up questions (e.g. “does she have experience with Angular.js”). It wastes time and derails the exercise. Focus on moving forward and reviewing as many profiles as possible.

You can view the email address of a 1st degree connection in the “Contact Info” section on LinkedIn, like this:

In 30 minutes, you should be able to tear through the employee’s connection list and generate anywhere between 2 - 30 good leads. And that’s just one employee.

Facebook, Github, Stackoverflow, etc.

People are more likely to be connected to close friends or acquaintances on Facebook than on LinkedIn. So do the exact same exercise with their Facebook account. And then their Twitter followers. And then their Github account (do they personally know anyone they follow or who follows them?). And then their Stackoverflow account. And then their Meetup.com profile. And on and on.

Lather, rinse, repeat

Move onto the next employee. And keep going until everyone’s network has been comprehensively mined. At this point you’ll have generated a kick ass list of leads to contact.

Contact every candidate

Now you need to personally contact all of the leads. Don’t leave this responsibility to each referrer, or the job won’t get done. Doing it yourself will be time consuming, but the rewards will be worth it. Even if it’s 150 leads, block out time in your calendar and smash them all out in one go. Then sit back and watch your future hires roll into your inbox.

Here are the secrets to effective outreach emails:

Brevity: Keep the email as brief as possible;
Social proof: Mention the person who referred them;
Call-to-action: Make sure your email ends with a call-to-action (i.e. “What time should I call you at this evening?).

Create a template and tweak it for each individual. Here’s an example:

Title: Hey [first name], [referrer full name] said you’re awesome. Free for a quick call this week?
 
Hi [first name],

I'm [your name], the founder and CTO of [company name]. [Referrer name] said you two previously worked together and that you’re an awesome [engineer/salesperson/accountant].

We’re building our team and think you’d make a great addition. If you don’t know [company name], [snappy description of what your company does and how you’re changing the world].

It looks like you have an great job and are probably enjoying it. But we're building a really amazing team here and I thought you might at least enjoy hearing about it. 

Are you free this week for a quick call to discuss?

Cheers,
[your name]

It’s really important to follow up a few days later with every lead who didn’t reply. You’ll be amazed at how many people will reply to your second attempt. A simple “Hey, just putting this to the top of your inbox in case the last email got caught in the crossfire...” should suffice. I guarantee you’ll get replies this time.

If they respond saying they’re not interested, reply to them with a quick note say “thanks, let’s stay in touch… oh, do you happen to know anyone who’s currently searching for roles?” Always be hustling for referrals. Remember, great people know great people, who know great people ;-)

Manage each candidate 

Referred candidates are highly valuable. So if they reply and express an interest, get them on the phone as soon as possible. As your company scales and you’re recruiting activities increase, you may not be able to speak with each one individual without some pre-screening. But at this stage, your company’s collective network is small, so you need to give each referral the white glove treatment. You’ve already done most of the work, get them over the finish line and turn them into active candidates in your pipeline.
