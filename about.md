Playfair Capital is an early stage venture capital investor. From our London headquarters, we invest in tenacious entrepreneurs building technology that generates a quantum leap in the way people live, work, and play for the better. Fundamentally, we want to invest in companies that matter. A core tenet of our ethos is to invest and work on a level playing field with our entrepreneurs. We partner closely with our teams to provide the financial, operational, and strategic support required to bring their visionary technologies to the world. Weâ€™ve backed companies across the UK, Europe, the US, and Africa. Playfair also operates a co-working space in London, Warner Yard, which is home to a dozen early stage technology startups, the London outpost of the Techstars accelerator, and a collaborative Angel and institutional investor floor.
