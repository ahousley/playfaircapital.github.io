# Size

We write our first cheque between £150k-£250k and have the capacity to follow-on in subsequent financing rounds for companies that outperform.

# Stage

The majority of our deals take place at the seed stage where we are often the first institutional money into the company. We like to take the lead in companies that we are particularly excited about and where we constitute the largest ticket size in the round. However, we are also happy to co-invest as part of a strong value-add syndicate where round sizes preclude us from leading. We take a long view on our investments and work alongside founding teams to reach the optimal outcome that makes the most sense for all parties involved.

# Sectors

We seek to invest in markets that are ripe for disruption or in entirely new markets created as a result of novel technology. We have invested across many marketplace business models and are increasingly focused on companies building innovative machine intelligence. We are however sector agnostic, choosing to invest in themes over markets. 

# Geography

We are not bound by any geographic restrictions and therefore will consider companies working anywhere in the world. By virtue of our London presence, the majority of our investments are in the UK, followed by the US, with the furthest afield being in Nigeria.

# OUR PROCESS
Here’s an outline of our investment process. We endeavour to make swift decisions, knowing full well that time is of the essence at the early stage. 
 
## 1. Learning about your company – We’re not interested in reading a 30 page business plan, but we expect to learn the following via a deck and our conversations:

Who is the team and what have they worked on in the past?
What product or service does your business offer?
Why are you working on this and why is now the right time?
Where is the industry going and how big is the opportunity?
Who are the other players in the space and why are they inadequate?
How quickly can you scale this into a global operation and what are the financial requirements to achieve this?
What hypotheses have you tested so far and what were the results?

If we’re intrigued by what we learn as a result of these questions, we’ll move forward in the process. If, however, we don’t feel that we’re a good fit for your company, we’ll let you know very quickly.

## 2. Getting to know you and the team

If one thing is true, it’s that your business, its products, and the market on which you focus is likely to change and adapt over time. As a result, we focus heavily on learning about the team. We need to be sure that the entrepreneurs we support are able to remain nimble in their thought process and execution so as to quickly pursue new opportunities that make sense for the company as broader market currents evolve.

We will invite you in to meet members of our investment team to discuss your company and your team in more detail. We want to know what makes you tick and whether you have the capabilities to lead a team and execute strategies both on a local and global scale. We will talk to people in our network who know you and reach out to early or potential customers to ascertain whether your team is one that they’re excited to do business with.

We’ll dig deeper into the market, your technology architecture and stack, your competition, and your products to arrive at an investment decision. Making swift decisions is a key tenet of our founder friendly ethos. If we do decide to move forward, we will then send you a term sheet outlining the key commercial terms of our investment proposal. We’ll work with you to build a strong syndicate of investors who will add value to your business in key areas.

If we decide not to invest, we promise not to waste your time and will always provide you with constructive feedback that outlines our thought process.  We don’t string you along with “maybe” responses because it’s unproductive for all parties involved.

## 3. Due Diligence

After we signed the term sheet agreeing headline commercial terms, we will then carry out a more extensive due diligence process with your help before the deal can close. This process can take several weeks as it involves further reference calls, financial, legal, and technology diligence, and drafting of long form legal documents. This is a necessary evil not only for us but also to ensure that everything is in place for the company to raise future financing rounds.

Providing all boxes are ticked, investors and the company will sign all legal documents and cash will be unlocked. And the journey begins!

## 4. Our View on Ownership

We need the founders of companies we invest in to maintain majority control for as long as possible to ensure that they’re incentivised to build significant value into the future. For that reason, we acquire minority stakes at the seed stage.

## 5. Board Seats and Our Continued Involvement

When Playfair buys into a team with an idea, our commitment is for the long term. If we are the lead investor, we will typically require one of the members of our investment team to join the Board of Directors to represent the interests of seed investors and bring maximum value to the table. Writing a cheque is only the start of our relationship, and we only want to work with founding teams who value our involvement and are excited to bring us on board. Our involvement in the company ranges from daily interactions to more passive relationships. This largely depends on the founding team and their need/desire for help, the extent to which we can add value to the business, as well as the capital we have invested in the company. While we consider ourselves active investors, we are by no means micromanagers. To find out more, we recommend you reach out to the teams we have backed.
